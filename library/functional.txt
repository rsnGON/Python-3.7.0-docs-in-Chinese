10. Functional Programming Modules
**********************************

The modules described in this chapter provide functions and classes
that support a functional programming style, and general operations on
callables.

The following modules are documented in this chapter:

* 10.1. "itertools" — Functions creating iterators for efficient
  looping

  * 10.1.1. Itertool functions

  * 10.1.2. Itertools Recipes

* 10.2. "functools" — Higher-order functions and operations on
  callable objects

  * 10.2.1. "partial" Objects

* 10.3. "operator" — Standard operators as functions

  * 10.3.1. Mapping Operators to Functions

  * 10.3.2. Inplace Operators
